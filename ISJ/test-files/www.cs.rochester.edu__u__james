A paper about the current state  of AI given at the 1998 AAAI conference can be found   <A HREF="ftp://ftp.cs.rochester.edu/pub/u/james/Allen-AIMag98.ps.gz"> here </A>   These areas of research are  combined in <A HREF="http://www.cs.rochester.edu/research/trains/">the TRAINS project</A>, a long term effort co-directed with  Len Schubert. The TRAINS system is an intelligent planning assistant  that can converse in spoken natural language with a person to create,  discuss and evaluate various plans involving freight shipments by  train. In particular, Allen's research breaks down into two main  subareas, broadly classified as research in discourse and research in  plan reasoning.  <P>  The research in discourse is focused on two-person extended dialogs  in which the speakers have specific tasks to accomplish. An emphasis  in this work is the representation and use of the context of the  dialog to solve problems in semantic interpretations and the  recognition of the intentions underlying the speakers' utterances.  Work in this area has included developing the first computational  model of speech acts, the development of a multi-level plan-based  analysis involving discourse-level plans as well as domain-level  plans, and the development of several different discourse-plan  recognition algorithms. In addition, we are exploring how prosody and  intonation signals discourse intentions and how this interacts with  the plan-based dialog model. While it is important for work to be  formally well-defined and understood, it is equally important that  computational theories can lead to effective implementations. As a  result, a considerable amount of effort has also been made in  developing an expressive hybrid knowledge representation system that  can support complex reasoning about plans and actions.  <P>  The research in plan reasoning draws much of its motivation from the  dialog work. In particular, the representation of plans must support a  wide range of different forms of reasoning: plan construction (i.e.  traditional planning), plan recognition, plan evaluation, and the  communication of plans between agents. Much of our work in this area  has focused on the representation of time and action, and we have  reformulated the planning problem as a problem in temporal reasoning.  Within this framework, we have developed a representation of plans  that is temporally explicit and supports plan construction,  recognition and communication. We are also exploring methods of  temporal reasoning that are viable even with large data sets of  temporal information.  <P>  <H2>Selected Publications on Temporal Reasoning</H2>  <UL>  <LI> Allen, J.F. ``Maintaining Knowledge about Temporal Intervals.''       Communications of the ACM 26, 11, 832-843, November 1983.  <LI> Allen, J.F. ``A General Model of Action and Time.''
